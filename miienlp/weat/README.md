# What does it do?

The purpose of this program is to calculate scores such as association and centeredness between different sets of words to approximate the relationships between those words. Currently, this program can run a *group-to-domain* test. For example, it can calculate the association between *male* (group) words with *career* (domain) words, the association between *female* (group) words with *career* (domain) words, and the *gender centeredness* of the career words.

After running those tests, this program can also clean and visualize the output of those tests.
