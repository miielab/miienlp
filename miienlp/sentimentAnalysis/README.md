# Sentiment Analysis with Categorization

## What does it do?

A BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation Transformer) fine-tuned for the task of sentiment analysis is used to calculate the sentiment in sentences in children's books. The user can create a list of words that are part of a certain category (for instance: apple, orange, and mango can be part of the fruit category) and this code will track the sentiment in the sentences that contain mentions of words in these categories. In this way, a user could compare the average sentiment towards different categories: say, male and female characters, or different fields of higher education (STEM vs. humanities majors).
