# Co-occurrence
## What does it do?
[Co-occurrence](https://towardsdatascience.com/simple-word-embedding-for-natural-language-processing-5484eeb05c06) is a simple and interpretable Natural Language Processing tool that looks at how frequently pairs of words co-occur in a set context window. It is a type of frequency-based word embedding that simply creates a count matrix of pairwise words or categories. Rather than looking at relationships between individual words, this part of the pipeline constructs co-occurrence matrices for word categories, in order to compare how frequently different groups and domains appear in the same context.
