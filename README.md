# MiiENLP Source Code (v 1.0.0)

Welcome! 

The MiiENLP open source package is a one stop shop for social scientists to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze texts and derive meaningful results. We created this package with the aim of making NLP and machine-implemented content analysis techniques more accessible to the general users who have zero or limited proficiency in python. We hope these tools will help our you catalyze new research in fields such as social sciences and computational social sciences. The repository contains the source code and examples for using the packages described in the pipeline below:

## Getting Started

If you are familiar with Python, please skip this part and go to Table of Contents section. It is worth noting that you should create a new environment in Python Version 3.7. to avoid any package compatibility issues. You may get an error if you are using a different version of Python. 

If you are completely new to Python, here are some [resources](https://github.com/miielab/miienlp/blob/afa9ff87adc58c1d447f538ab4d91b791b27662c/examples/python_installation.md) to get you started. We include instructions on how to install python and create a new environment in Python ver.3.7. using command line.
